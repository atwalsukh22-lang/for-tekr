    <p>Happy New Year!</p>

    <p>
      First of all, thank you for coming into my life and filling it with so much care and love.
      I hope we continue being together like this, sharing all our laughter and sorrows side by side.
    </p>

    <p>
      May this year, and all the years ahead, be full of happiness, warmth, and beautiful memories.
      You make Sukh really happy, more than you even realize.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please take good care of yourself, and always remember that I’m right here for you.
      You are deeply cared for, endlessly loved, and always special to me.
    </p>
